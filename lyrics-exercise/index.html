            So sentimental <br>
            Not sentimental no <br>
            Romantic not discussing it <br>
            Darling I'm down and lonely <br>
            When were the fortunate only? <br>
            I've been looking for something else <br>
            Too late, too late, too late, she'll be late, too late, too late <br>
            So go slowly discourage <br>
            Distant from other interests <br>
            On your favorite weekend <br>
            Ending this love for gentlemen only <br>
            That's where the fortunate only <br>
            No I gotta be someone else <br>
            These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes <br> <br>
            A Lisztomania <br>
            Think less but see it grow <br>
            Like a riot like a riot oh <br>
            Not easily offended <br>
            Know how to let it go <br>
            From the mess to the masses <br> <br>
            A Lisztomania <br>
            Think less but see it grow <br>
            Like a riot like a riot oh <br>
            Not easily offended <br>
            Know how to let it go <br>
            From the mess to the masses <br> <br>
            Follow, misguide, stand still <br>
            Discuss, discourage <br>
            On this precious weekend <br>
            Ending this love for gentlemen only <br>
            Wealthier gentlemen only <br>
            Now that you're lonely <br>
            Too late, too late, too late, she'll be late, too late, too late <br>
            So go slowly discourage <br>
            We'll burn the pictures instead <br>
            When it's all over we can barely discuss <br>
            For one minute only <br>
            Not where the fortunate only <br>
            But I better be something else <br>
            These days it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes and goes <br> <br>
            A Lisztomania <br>
