Great job on the site and recreating something that's very similar to what was in the mockup! I think it's a super strong start. Here are a few suggestions:

1. I think the menu/nav bar could be little less wide. I think it's eating up a but too much of the page. Maybe making the width a fixed pixel size instead of a percentage would fix the issue.

2. I like the colors and how clean it looks, but I wish there was a little more personality to it. I think adding the big image to the landing page like you had in the mockup would be a start. I also think a low-opacity texture/pattern could be added to the background of either the menu bar or the main pages. I have no idea how this would work, but if you google "rock texture" maybe something like that could be added to the background. 

3. The responsiveness of it is really impressive. I realized, however, that the menu bar is super tall and takes up a big chunk of the page (before you scroll) when the window resizes. Maybe it could become a drop down or goes horizontal.
