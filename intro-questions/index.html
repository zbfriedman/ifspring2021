        <h1>Introductory questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Hi, I'm Zach. I'm a junior majoring in Design with minors in Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction.</li>
            <!-- Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class. -->
            <li> I'm really intersted in the UX design field. This is why I love being at the intersection of design and development. I'm excited for this class because I want to learn more about proper interaction and interface design.</li>
            <!-- Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it. -->
            <li> I have pretty extensive experience with HTML and CSS from my computer science classes. I have mainly used it for basic website construction, so I'm looking forward to using it in a more design-oriented way.</li>
            <!-- Name one thing you hope to learn in this class. -->
            <li> I really want to learn more CSS in this class.</li>
            <!-- Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper. -->
            <li> I think a main difference between designing for screens and paper is scalability. Designing for screens must take mobile, tablet, and web sizing all into account. This type of accessibility adds a whole different perspective to this type of design.</li>
            <!-- Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice. -->
            <li> <a href="http://reyka.com/#?verified=true"> Rekya Vodka </a> has a fantastic design in my opinion. I think the images and the colors are very satisfying. The website can offer a lot of information, and it's very easy to use and not too overwhelming. I discovered this after traveling to Iceland, and I truly believe it does a great job of feeling Icelandic. </li>
            <li> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com"> FiveThirtyEight</a> is a website that has clear communication. There is a lot of text on the page, but the simple grid design makes it fairly straightforward to use. It feels different from other news sites, which I appreciate. </li>
            <li> I think <a href="https://calendly.com"> Calendly </a> offers a fantastic service through a website that has super clear design.  I think the very simple and clean design of the website makes using it easy, quick, and enjoyable. Scheduling meetings can be stressful, but this service makes it easy. </li>
